# About
SGAccessoryFramework is the result of one of my more recent projects that
involved developing an iOS application for the iPhone using the EAAccessoryFramework.

# Future direction
Implement a standalone library that could be plugged into any existing or new
iOS application's source to enable accessory based functionality. The goal is to
use Cocoa programming best practices.
